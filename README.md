A timer for pair programming

## Development

As this is a basic HTML page, need to uncomment the development scripts. Comment the production script.

Then to serve this to a page run:

```bash
npx serve
```

## JavaScript minification

```bash
npx terser --compress --mangle -o js/bundle.js -- js/main.js js/vue.min.js
```
